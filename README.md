# Common Issues

* Currently due to a bug, you must log into a Steam client that owns a copy of Dead Matter at least once in order to start the dedicated server. You can log out after logging into the client once. It is not confirmed if you can restart the machine after logging out and reboot the server without having to log back into a client.

# Port Forwarding

The ports you need to have open are:

* UDP 27016 - Steam server query
* UDP/TCP 7777 - Dead Matter 1
* UDP/TCP 7778 - Dead Matter 2

# Server Config

The server configuration can be changed via editing the config `.ini` files located in `[ServerInstallDirectory]/deadmatter/Saved/Config/WindowsServer`. The file, section, and variable to change depends on the variable being modified.

If not otherwise specified, the file to modify is `Game.ini`.

## Example

If we are modifying `Game.ini`,

```
[/Script/DeadMatter.DMGameSession]
ServerName=My Server
```

The above snippet will cause the server name to be displayed as "My Server".
